## Dev Notes

### Project Context

Story 4.3 is the third story in Epic 4: Documentation & Developer Experience. This story focuses on empowering developers to solve problems independently through comprehensive troubleshooting documentation. By the time a developer reaches this documentation, they've already learned the system basics from the README (4.1) and architecture docs (4.2).

By this point in the project:
- **Epic 1** (stories 1.1-1.7): Complete foundation with all services running
- **Epic 2** (stories 2.1-2.5): Service health checks and observability in place
- **Epic 3** (stories 3.1-3.5): Configuration and secret management implemented
- **Story 4.1**: README and getting started guide completed
- **Story 4.2**: Architecture and service documentation completed

The troubleshooting guide completes the developer experience by helping them diagnose and resolve issues independently.

### Key Requirements from PRD (Story 4.3)

**User Story**: As a developer, I want comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for common issues, so that I can resolve problems independently without asking for help.

**Acceptance Criteria Reference**:
1. Troubleshooting guide covers: port conflicts, Docker issues, service startup failures, database connection errors
2. Each issue includes: symptoms, cause, and step-by-step resolution
3. FAQ section answers common questions about customization, performance, and usage
4. Documentation includes commands for common debugging tasks (view logs, restart service, check status)
5. Troubleshooting guide includes escalation path for issues not covered
6. Documentation is searchable and well-organized

### System Architecture Overview (for context)

**Services**:
1. **Frontend** (React/TypeScript/Tailwind): User-facing web application running on port 3000
   - Location: `/frontend`
   - Common issues: Hot reload failures, API connection errors, CSS/styling issues
   - Debug tools: Browser DevTools, Network tab, Console errors

2. **Backend API** (Node.js/Dora/TypeScript): REST API service running on port 3001
   - Location: `/backend`
   - Common issues: Database connection failures, Redis connection issues, route errors
   - Debug tools: Console logs, stacktraces, health check endpoint

3. **PostgreSQL** (Database): Primary data store running on port 5432
   - Location: `/database`
   - Common issues: Connection timeouts, schema initialization errors, permission issues
   - Debug tools: psql CLI, direct SQL queries, trigger/transaction inspection

4. **Redis** (Cache): In-memory cache running on port 6379
   - Common issues: Connection failures, memory issues, persistence problems
   - Debug tools: redis-cli, memory monitoring, data inspection

**Docker Networking**:
- All services on `zero-to-running-network`
- DNS resolution: service names resolve to internal IPs within containers
- Port mappings expose services to localhost on host machine
- Health checks verify service readiness

### Common Issue Categories

Based on the system architecture, common issues typically fall into these categories:

1. **Port Conflicts** - When running locally, ports 3000, 3001, 5432, 6379 must be available
2. **Docker Issues** - Container startup, networking, volume mounting, resource constraints
3. **Service Startup Failures** - Dependencies not ready, configuration issues, missing files
4. **Database Connection Errors** - Network issues, authentication, schema problems
5. **Performance Issues** - Resource constraints, missing indexes, inefficient queries
6. **Configuration Issues** - Wrong environment variables, missing .env file, credential issues

### Files to Create/Modify

**New documentation files to create**:
- `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Main troubleshooting guide (5-10 pages)
  - Common issues and resolution steps
  - Debugging commands reference
  - FAQ section
  - Escalation path

**Existing files to reference**:
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions (created in Story 4.1)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture details (created in Story 4.2)
- `docs/NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Docker networking details
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Environment variables and configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions and port mappings
- `docs/HEALTH_VERIFICATION.md` - Health check mechanisms

### Existing Documentation to Reference

The developer should review and reference these existing documents:

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** - System architecture and service documentation
- **`docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md`** - Startup sequence and orchestration
- **`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`** - Environment variables and configuration options
- **`docs/NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Docker networking setup

- **`docs/LOGGING.md`** - Logging implementation and patterns
- **`docs/MONITORING.md`** - Monitoring and observability
- **`README.md`** - Quick start and project overview

### Expected Issue Scenarios

**Port Conflicts (Port 3000, 3001, 5432, 6379)**
- **Symptoms**: Docker container fails to start, "Address already in use" errors
- **Causes**: Another application using the same port, previous incomplete shutdown
- **Resolution**: Use `lsof -i :PORT` to find process, `kill` the process or use different ports in docker-compose

**Docker Daemon Not Running**
- **Symptoms**: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon" error
- **Causes**: Docker service not started on system
- **Resolution**: Start Docker service using OS-specific commands (systemctl, brew services, etc.)

**Database Connection Timeout**
- **Symptoms**: "connect ECONNREFUSED", "FATAL: remaining connection slots reserved"
- **Causes**: Database not ready, network issue, wrong credentials
- **Resolution**: Check service is running with `docker-compose ps`, verify PostgreSQL health check, check credentials

**Frontend Cannot Connect to Backend**
- **Symptoms**: API calls return 404, CORS errors, connection refused
- **Causes**: Backend not running, wrong API URL in environment variable, port mismatch
- **Resolution**: Verify backend is running, check VITE_API_URL env var, verify port 3001 is accessible

**Service Startup Timeout**
- **Symptoms**: Service exits with non-zero status, takes too long to start
- **Causes**: Resource constraints, dependency not ready, initialization script hanging
- **Resolution**: Check available memory/CPU, view service logs, increase timeout if needed

**Database Schema Not Initialized**
- **Symptoms**: "relation does not exist" errors, table not found
- **Causes**: init.sql not executed, permission issues, migration incomplete
- **Resolution**: Check PostgreSQL logs, verify init.sql permissions, manually run migrations if needed
