## Dev Notes

### Project Context

This story establishes the frontend UI layer as a containerized React/TypeScript application using Tailwind CSS for styling. The frontend is a critical component of the Zero-to-Running Developer Environment, providing the user-facing interface that demonstrates the complete stack is working. This story builds on the foundation of Stories 1.1-1.4 (Repository Setup, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Backend API).

By completing this story, developers will have:
- A modern React application running in a Docker container with hot reload
- TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- A health status display that demonstrates frontend-to-backend communication
- A development workflow that enables rapid UI development with instant feedback

### Relevant Architecture & Technical Context

**Service Architecture**: The frontend service is the user-facing layer of the containerized microservices setup. It will make HTTP requests to the backend API (running on port 3001) to demonstrate inter-service communication.

**Technical Details from PRD**:
- Frontend uses React and TypeScript (per PRD FR12 and technical assumption 12)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (per PRD technical assumptions)
- Hot reload enabled with React Fast Refresh via dev server (per PRD technical assumption 7)
- Environment variables for configuration (per PRD technical assumption 5)
- Docker Compose orchestration (per PRD technical assumptions)
- Must make API calls to backend using environment variable for API URL

**Build Tool Recommendation**: Vite is recommended over Create React App (CRA) because:
- Significantly faster development server startup and hot reload
- Smaller production bundle with better tree-shaking
- Native ESM support in development
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Lower resource consumption on developer machines (NFR6)
- Better HMR reliability in Docker containers
- Minimal configuration needed

**Key Ports**:
- Frontend application port: 3000 (configurable via PORT or FRONTEND_PORT env var)
- Vite HMR (Hot Module Replacement) port: 5173 (internal to Vite dev server, needs careful Docker config)

**Backend Integration**:
- API URL: `http://localhost:3001` (or configured via REACT_APP_API_URL)
- Health check endpoint to call: `GET /health` (returns `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"ISO-8601"}`)
- CORS should be pre-configured on backend (or frontend makes same-origin requests via proxy if needed)

**Communication Pattern**:
- Frontend will make fetch/axios calls to `${API_URL}/health` on component mount
- Display response in UI with health status indicator
- Handle network errors gracefully (show offline/unavailable message)

### Dependency Context

**Completed Stories**:
- Story 1.1: Project Repository & Build System - provides Makefile, .env.example template, directory structure
- Story 1.2: PostgreSQL Database Service - establishes docker-compose.yml foundation
- Story 1.3: Redis Cache Service - adds Redis service to docker-compose.yml
- Story 1.4: Backend API Service Foundation - backend running on port 3001 with /health endpoint

**Prerequisites**:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on developer machine
- Node.js 20+ installed locally (for development, containerized version used for execution)
- Existing docker-compose.yml from Story 1.4 with PostgreSQL, Redis, and backend services
- Backend service running and accessible at http://localhost:3001 (or configured host)

**Following Stories**:
- Story 1.6: Service Orchestration - implements `make dev` command to start all services together
- Story 1.7: Inter-Service Communication - validates frontend can call backend API successfully
- Story 2.1: Frontend Enhancement - adds additional UI components and pages
- Story 2.2: API Integration - implements business logic API calls beyond health check

### Environment Variables Required

Based on .env.example (Story 1.1) and project standards:

**Frontend Application Configuration**:
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: Frontend service port (default: 3000, passed to Vite dev server)
- `PORT`: Alternative to FRONTEND_PORT (some tools use PORT)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production, default: development)
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend API base URL (default: http://localhost:3001)
  - Note: Must start with REACT_APP_ to be available in React app
  - Vite uses VITE_ prefix, but for compatibility use both or configure via vite.config.ts

**Docker Configuration**:
- `FRONTEND_PORT` or `PORT`: Passed to docker-compose.yml for port mapping
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "development" in docker-compose for dev builds
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Passed to container for API communication

### Recommended Project Structure

After completing this story, frontend directory structure should be:

```
/frontend/
├── README.md                    # Frontend documentation
├── package.json                 # Node.js dependencies

└── node_modules/              # Dependencies (git-ignored)
```

### Development Workflow

Developers will:
1. Have frontend service running in Docker container
2. Edit TypeScript/TSX files locally in /frontend/src/
3. Changes automatically reloaded via Vite HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
4. Access UI at `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port)
5. See health status indicator showing backend connectivity
6. Use browser developer tools for debugging (with source maps)

### API Integration Approach

**For Health Status Display**:

```typescript
// src/App.tsx example pattern
useEffect(() => {
  const checkHealth = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/health`);
      if (response.ok) {
        const data = await response.json();
        setHealthStatus('healthy');
      } else {
        setHealthStatus('unhealthy');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      setHealthStatus('unavailable');
    }
  };

  checkHealth();
  // Optional: set up interval to poll health periodically
}, []);
```

**API URL Configuration**:
- Use environment variable: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'`
- Create centralized config in src/config/api.ts for consistency
- Support both development and production URLs via environment variables

### Testing Standards

**Testing Coverage for This Story**:

**Manual Testing** (Developer Responsibility):
1. Frontend service starts successfully in Docker
2. Landing page loads at http://localhost:3000 (or configured port)
3. Landing page displays "Zero-to-Running Environment - Ready!" message
4. Health status shows backend connectivity (animated loader while checking)
5. When backend is healthy: shows green indicator with "Backend API: Healthy"
6. When backend is unavailable: shows red indicator with "Backend API: Unavailable"
7. Hot reload works: modify src/App.tsx, save, and see changes without full page reload
8. Network requests to backend show in browser DevTools Network tab
9. TypeScript errors are caught during development (in Vite console)
10. Production build completes without errors: `npm run build`

**Testing Framework Recommendations** (For Future Stories):
- **Component Tests**: Vitest for unit testing React components with TypeScript support
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright or Cypress for full stack testing (when backend integration is more complex)
- **Test Setup**: Tests will likely be added in Story 2.x when more business logic is implemented

**Quality Metrics for This Story**:
- TypeScript compilation with no errors or warnings
- Vite builds successfully (dev and prod)
- Docker image builds without issues
- Container starts without errors
- Health check endpoint reachable from frontend (verify in Network tab)
- No React warnings or console errors in development
- No unhandled promise rejections

### Important Notes for Developer

1. **Vite HMR Configuration in Docker**:
   - Vite HMR may need special config to work across container boundaries
   - Configure HMR host/port in vite.config.ts for Docker:
   ```typescript
   server: {
     hmr: {
       host: 'localhost',
       port: 5173
     }
   }
   ```
   - Alternatively, use `--host` flag in dev script to listen on all interfaces

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Use strict mode in tsconfig.json: `"strict": true`
   - Include JSX/TSX support: `"jsx": "react-jsx"` (React 17+)
   - Configure module resolution for imports

3. **React 18 Patterns**:
   - Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
   - Use `useEffect` for side effects (API calls)
   - Use `useState` for component state
   - Ensure proper dependency arrays in useEffect

4. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - Use utility classes directly in JSX (e.g., `className="bg-blue-500 text-white"`)
   - Configure tailwind.config.js to include all src files in content paths
   - Import index.css with Tailwind directives in App component or index.tsx

5. **API Error Handling**:
   - Always handle fetch/axios errors gracefully
   - Don't let API failures crash the application
   - Show user-friendly error messages instead of raw errors
   - Consider implementing retry logic for resilience

6. **Environment Variables**:
   - React environment variables must be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` (Vite uses `VITE_`)
   - For compatibility, either use both prefixes or configure in vite.config.ts
   - Load from environment at build time (not runtime in SPA)

7. **Docker Volume Mounts**:
   - Frontend source code must be mounted: `- ./frontend:/app`
   - node_modules should be excluded or use separate volume: `/app/node_modules`
   - Ensures hot reload works and isolation from host node_modules

8. **Port Configuration**:
   - Development server should listen on 0.0.0.0 (not just localhost) to be accessible from host
   - Use PORT or FRONTEND_PORT environment variable
   - Vite default is 5173, must be changed to 3000 in config

### Architecture Assumptions

1. **Docker Compose Network**: Frontend and backend are on same docker network, service discovery works by service name

2. **API Accessibility**: Backend `/health` endpoint is publicly accessible without authentication (appropriate for health checks)

3. **Volume Mounts**: Source code is mounted into container for hot reload; node_modules installed in container

4. **CORS Handling**: Either backend has CORS enabled for frontend requests, or frontend makes same-origin requests (if on same domain/port after deployment)

5. **Environment Variables**: All configuration comes from environment variables, not hardcoded URLs

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Story**:
- Primarily UI setup and boilerplate code
- React and Vite are well-established and documented
- TypeScript compilation catches many issues automatically
- Docker container ensures reproducibility

**Potential Challenges**:
1. **HMR Issues in Docker**: Hot reload may not work across container boundaries without proper configuration
   - Solution: Configure Vite HMR host/port or use `--host 0.0.0.0`
2. **Port Conflicts**: If port 3000 already in use on developer machine
   - Solution: Configure via FRONTEND_PORT or PORT env var in .env
3. **API Connection Failures**: If backend not running or CORS issues
   - Solution: Check backend health endpoint manually, verify CORS headers, check API_URL is correct
4. **Large npm install**: Initial dependency installation might take time
   - Solution: Use npm ci instead of npm install for Docker builds
5. **TypeScript Errors**: Strict mode may catch type mismatches
   - Solution: Use proper typing for React components and props

---

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture

**Frontend Testing Standards** (to be documented in architecture/testing-standards.md):

- **Component Testing Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Test File Location**: `src/__tests__/` or co-located with components as `.test.tsx`
- **Test Patterns**:
  - Unit tests for utility functions
  - Component tests using React Testing Library (not Enzyme)
  - Mock API responses for API-dependent components
  - Avoid testing implementation details, test user behavior

- **For This Story** (Minimal Coverage):
  - No unit tests required (boilerplate setup)
  - Manual testing via browser sufficient for landing page verification
  - Future stories will add proper test coverage as components become more complex

- `/.env` - Updated with VITE_API_URL environment variable

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Approach:**
- Used Vite as build tool for fast development and HMR (recommended over Create React App)
- Configured strict TypeScript settings for production-ready code
- Implemented responsive landing page with gradient background and glassmorphic design
- Added health status polling (30-second intervals) for real-time backend connectivity monitoring
- Configured Vite HMR with watch.usePolling for reliable hot reload in Docker containers
- Created comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guide

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Vite over CRA**: Better performance, smaller bundles, native ESM support
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid UI development
3. **Fetch API**: Native browser API for HTTP requests (no axios dependency)
4. **React 18 Hooks**: Modern functional component patterns with useEffect and useState
5. **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Separate development, build, and production stages for flexibility

**Environment Variables:**
- `FRONTEND_PORT` (or `PORT`): Development server port (default: 3000)
- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Node environment (development/production)

**Docker Integration:**
- Frontend service depends on backend health check (waits for backend to be ready)
- Volume mounts for hot reload: `./frontend:/app` and `/app/node_modules`
- Network: Connected to `zero-to-running-network` for inter-service communication
- Port mapping: Configurable via FRONTEND_PORT environment variable

**Manual Testing Performed:**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with zero errors
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ All source files created and structured correctly
- ✅ Dependencies installed without vulnerabilities
- ✅ Docker Compose service defined with proper configuration
- ✅ Environment variables configured in .env and .env.example
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive and complete

**QA Feedback Applied (2025-11-10):**
- ✅ AC7 Fix: Updated landing page heading in App.tsx to display unified message "Zero-to-Running Environment - Ready!" as specified in acceptance criteria (was previously split across heading and status badge)
- Impact: One-line change in `/frontend/src/App.tsx` line 62 to match AC7 specification exactly

**Notes for QA:**
- Frontend service requires backend to be running for health status to work
- Health status will show "unavailable" if backend is not accessible
- Hot reload requires Docker restart if Vite config changes
- CORS must be enabled on backend for API calls from http://localhost:3000
