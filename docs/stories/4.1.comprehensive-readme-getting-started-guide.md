## Dev Notes

### Project Context

Story 4.1 is the first story in Epic 4: Documentation & Developer Experience. This story is critical for developer onboarding and first impressions. The README is often the first contact point for new developers, so clarity, accuracy, and completeness are paramount.

At this point in the project, the following stories have been completed:
- Epic 1: Foundation & Local Development Infrastructure (stories 1.1-1.7)
- Epic 2: Service Health & Observability (stories 2.1-2.5)
- Epic 3: Configuration & Secret Management (stories 3.1-3.5)

The developer implementing this story should have the complete, functioning system to reference and test against.

### Key Requirements from PRD (Story 4.1)

**User Story**: As a new developer, I want clear, step-by-step documentation for initial setup, so that I can get started without prior knowledge of the project.

**Acceptance Criteria Reference**:
1. README includes: project overview, prerequisites, quick start (3-step process), and link to full documentation
2. Quick start guide gets a developer from git clone to running environment in under 5 minutes
3. Prerequisites clearly list required software with version numbers and installation links
4. Documentation includes expected output/screenshots for successful setup
5. README includes troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
6. Documentation is well-formatted with clear headings, code blocks, and visual hierarchy

### From Architecture (Completed Stories)

By this point, the project has:
- Complete Docker Compose setup for 4 services (frontend, backend, database, cache)
- Health check endpoints for verification
- Structured logging implementation
- Monitoring/status commands
- Configuration system with .env support
- Multi-profile support (minimal, full)
- Port conflict detection
- Database seeding capability

This story should leverage these completed features to create clear, accurate documentation.

### README Structure (Recommended)

```
# Zero-to-Running Developer Environment

## Table of Contents

1. Overview
2. Prerequisites
3. Quick Start (3 steps)
4. What's Running
5. Next Steps
6. Troubleshooting
7. Architecture Overview (optional)
```

### Implementation Notes

**Existing README**: Note that a README.md was created in Story 1.1. This may need to be significantly expanded with the full documentation, or a new GETTING_STARTED.md could be created and linked from the main README.

**Links to Other Documentation**: The README should link to (and assume existence of):
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Full getting started guide
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture documentation
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide (may be part of this story)

**Version Numbers**: The developer implementing this story should verify actual version numbers:
- Docker Desktop/Engine minimum supported version
- Node.js version used in this project
- Make version requirements (usually any GNU Make 3.81+)
- Git version requirements

**Estimated Setup Time**: PRD specifies under 5 minutes. This assumes:
- Developer has prerequisites installed
- Docker images are cached (first run may take longer due to downloads)
- Network connectivity is good

**Platform Support**: Document that the tool supports:
- macOS (10.15+ with Docker Desktop)
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL/CentOS with Docker Engine)
- Windows (via WSL2 with Docker Desktop)

### Testing Standards

**Documentation Review** (Not traditional unit tests):
- Manual verification that each quick start step works
- Verify prerequisites are correct and complete
- Test all troubleshooting scenarios
- Check all links and references are valid
- Verify expected output matches actual system behavior
- Ensure estimated time is accurate

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Verify the 3-step process works
git clone <repo> test-setup
cd test-setup
cp .env.example .env
make dev
# ... wait and verify all services running
make down
```

### Common Implementation Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Outdated Version Numbers**: PRD/Architecture may specify different versions than what's actually implemented
2. **Incomplete Prerequisites**: Missing optional but highly useful tools (nvm, docker-compose, etc.)
3. **Inaccurate Timing**: 5-minute estimate is aggressive; ensure it's realistic
4. **Missing Platform-Specific Instructions**: Windows developers using WSL2 need specific steps
5. **Vague Troubleshooting**: Generic advice like "check your installation" is unhelpful; provide specific commands
6. **Dead Links**: Ensure all referenced documentation exists before linking to it

### Files Related to This Story

**Existing files created in Story 1.1** (likely needs significant expansion):
- `/README.md` - Main project README

**Files that should exist by now** (verify before writing):
- `/.env.example` - Environment variables (Story 1.1)
- `/Makefile` - Build targets including `make dev`, `make down` (Story 1.6)
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions (Story 1.2+)
- `/infrastructure/scripts/startup.sh` - Startup orchestration (Story 1.6)
- `/infrastructure/scripts/health-check.sh` - Health verification (Story 2.3)

**New files to create**:
- Update `/README.md` with complete getting started guide (or create separate `GETTING_STARTED.md`)
- Optional: `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting (could be in main README)

### Success Criteria for Implementation

- [ ] New developer can follow the 3-step process and have running environment in under 5 minutes
- [ ] All prerequisites are clear with version numbers and installation links
- [ ] Troubleshooting section covers at least 5 common issues with step-by-step solutions
- [ ] Expected output is documented and matches actual system behavior
- [ ] README is well-organized with clear navigation (table of contents)
- [ ] All code examples are accurate and tested
- [ ] All links to documentation are valid
- [ ] Markdown renders correctly without formatting issues

### Dependencies and Assumptions

**Assumes completed**:
- All stories from Epic 1 (infrastructure, services)
- All stories from Epic 2 (health checks, logging)
- All stories from Epic 3 (configuration, secrets)
- Makefile with `make dev` and `make down` commands
- Docker Compose setup with 4 running services
- Health check endpoints on backend
- Status command working

**Independence**: This story is primarily documentation and doesn't block or depend on other stories (except that the system must be functioning to document it accurately).
