nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security posture with strong password validation, secret length requirements, weak credential detection, and proper masking of sensitive values in logs. No exposure of credentials in documentation.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Configuration loaded once at startup using singleton pattern. Validation is lightweight. No runtime performance impact. Logging optimized to debug mode only.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Configuration validation prevents startup with invalid settings. Graceful error handling with clear error messages. Backend startup verification prevents runtime failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear code structure with TypeScript interfaces, comprehensive comments, and well-organized validation logic. Easy to extend for new configuration variables.'
