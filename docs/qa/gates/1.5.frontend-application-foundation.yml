# Gate Decision Summary
summary: |
  Story 1.5 - Frontend Application Foundation has successfully passed QA re-review.

  Initial review identified a minor AC7 form issue where the landing page heading was split
  across UI elements. The development agent has successfully addressed this by updating
  App.tsx line 62 to display the unified heading "Zero-to-Running Environment - Ready!"
  exactly as specified in the acceptance criteria.

  All 8 acceptance criteria are now fully met and verified. Code quality is excellent (95/100),
  and all non-functional requirements (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  are passing.

  This story is ready for closure (Done status).
