# Acceptance Criteria Status
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC1
    title: Docker Compose configuration includes Redis service definition
    status: PASS
    notes: Redis service properly defined with redis:7-alpine, correct networking, and restart policy

  - id: AC2
    title: Redis port is exposed and configurable (default 6379)
    status: PASS
    notes: Port exposure uses environment variable override with proper default fallback

  - id: AC3
    title: Redis is accessible from backend service via Docker network DNS
    status: PASS
    notes: Service connected to zero-to-running-network with DNS resolution documented

  - id: AC4
    title: "Optional: Redis data persists in a named Docker volume"
    status: PASS
    notes: Named volume with AOF persistence enabled exceeds requirements

  - id: AC5
    title: Documentation explains how to verify Redis connectivity
    status: PASS
    notes: 7.5KB comprehensive documentation exceeds requirements with multiple verification methods
